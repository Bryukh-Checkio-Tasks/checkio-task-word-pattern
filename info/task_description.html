    Sophia's drones are simple and can recognize symbols in a word only as a digit or a letter.
    She wants to learn drones to understand commands that are represented as "words" consisted by letters and digits.
    For that Sophia uploaded "patterns" which describe the sequence of digits and letters in the command.
    But drone memory can store only integer numbers and convert it in binary format for comparing.
    We should help Sophia and write module for comparing pattern and command.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a pattern as a positive integer and a command as a word.
    For the comparing drone should convert integer pattern in binary form, add zeroes to left for the command length and
    compare this combination with the command.<br>
    <strong>1 is a letter. 0 is a digit.</strong><br>
    If the pattern and the command are coincided, then return True, else -- False.
</p>

<div>
    For example. The pattern is 42 and the command is "12a0b3e4".<br>
    42 == 101010 in binary form, but this is not enough of length. Let's append zeroes -- "00101010".
    Then compare:
    <pre class="brush: text">
      42 == 00101010
12a0b3e4 == DDLDLDLD
--------------------
    True    VVVVVVVV
    </pre>

    One more example -- 101 and "ab23b4zz":
    <pre class="brush: text">
     101 == 01100101
ab23b4zz == LLDDLDLL
--------------------
   False    XVXVXXXV
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. A pattern as a positive integer and a command as a string.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Is the pattern coincide with the command or not as a boolean.
